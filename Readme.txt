Update
Aug 31, 2020 - Noise image optimize with 8bit DNA Genetic Algorithm
Aug 31, 2020 - Noise image optimize and attack simple MNIST classification model
Sep  2, 2020 - Merge images using XOR operator, DNA type changed int8,  When N_Gen. = 200, POP_SIZE = 100, decreased accuracy was 6%
Sep 11, 2020 - Try Multicore GA process using pytorch. but torch testset runtime is too high
